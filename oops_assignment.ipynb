        "# **OOPS TTHEORITICAL QUESTIONS:**\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "    \n",
        "  ->  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that utilizes \"objects\" to represent data and methods that operate on that data. OOP is centered around four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. This approach helps in organizing code in a modular way, making it easier to maintain and scale applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "##2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "-> Class: A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "-> An object is an instance of a class. It contains data and can perform actions defined by its class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "##4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "-> Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class, restricting access to some components. It focuses on how an object does what it does.\n",
        "\n",
        "##5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "  ->  Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\") are special methods in Python that allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in functions. They are also known as magic methods. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. __init__: Initializes an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. __str__: Returns a string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. __repr__: Returns an unambiguous string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "      \n",
        "        def __init__(self, value):\n",
        "            self.value = value\n",
        "            \n",
        "        def __str__(self):\n",
        "            return f\"Example with value: {self.value}\"\n",
        "            \n",
        "    obj = Example(10)\n",
        "    print(obj)  # Output: Example with value: 10\n",
        "    \n",
        "##6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "-> Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Animal:\n",
        "        def speak(self):\n",

        "    dog = Dog()\n",
        "    print(dog.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
        "    print(dog.bark())   # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "\n",
        "##7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "        def speak(self):\n",
        "            return \"Cat meows\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    def animal_sound(animal):\n",
        "        print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "    animal_sound(Dog())  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
        "    animal_sound(Cat())  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "\n",
        "##8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Encapsulation is achieved by using private variables and providing public methods to access them.\n",
        "\n",
        "    class BankAccount:\n",
        "        def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "            self.__balance = balance  # Private variable\n",
        "        \n",
        "        def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "            self.__balance += amount\n",
        "        \n",
        "        def get_balance(self):\n",
        "            return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "    account = BankAccount(100)\n",
        "    account.deposit(50)\n",
        "    print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 150\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "  -> The constructor in Python is defined using __init__. It initializes the object's attributes when an instance of the class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Person:\n",
        "        def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "    person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "    print(person.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
        "\n",
        "##10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "-> Class Method: A method that belongs to the class rather than any instance. It is defined using @classmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "    class MyClass:\n",
        "        count = 0\n",
        "        \n",
        "        @classmethod\n",
        "        def increment_count(cls):\n",
        "            cls.count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "    MyClass.increment_count()\n",
        "    print(MyClass.count)  # Output: 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Method: A method that does not access or modify class or instance state. Defined using @staticmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Math:\n",
        "        @staticmethod\n",
        "        def add(x, y):\n",
        "            return x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(Math.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "## 11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "-> Python does not support method overloading directly; instead, you can use default parameters to achieve similar functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Math:\n",
        "        def add(self, x, y=0):\n",

        "    print(math.add(5, 3))   # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "## 12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "-> Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Bird:\n",
        "        def fly(self):\n",

        "    print(penguin.fly())  # Output: Penguin can't fly\n",
        "\n",
        "## 13 What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "-> The property decorator allows you to define getter and setter methods for private attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Circle:\n",
        "        def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "            self.__radius = radius\n",

        "    print(circle.radius)   # Output: 10\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "-> Polymorphism enhances flexibility and allows for dynamic method resolution, enabling code to be more generic and reusable across different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "##15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "-> An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. This is defined using the abc module.\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

        "\n",
        "###Purpose of __str__\n",
        "The __str__ method is designed to provide a readable and user-friendly string representation of an object. It is invoked when you use the str() function or when you print an object using the print() function. The output from __str__ should be easy to understand for end-users.\n",

        "\n",
        "###Purpose of __repr__\n",
        "The __repr__ method, on the other hand, aims to provide an unambiguous string representation of an object that is useful for debugging and development. The goal is to convey enough information about the object so that it could be recreated if needed. This method is called when you use the repr() function or when an object is displayed in the interactive shell.\n",

        "##21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's useful for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",

        "    del resource            # Output will be \"Resource cleaned up\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> @staticmethod: Does not require access to instance or class; behaves like a regular function.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod: Takes cls as its first parameter; can access or modify class state.\n",
